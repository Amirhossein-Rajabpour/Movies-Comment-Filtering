# Movies-Comment-Filtering
A website is written with the Django framework. You can add comments for movies in voice (flac) format and then it uses a [Speech To Text service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) from IBM to convert it to text format, and then using another API from IBM ([Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)) it distinguishes the level of anger in that text and if it is lower than a constant amount, then the comment will be accepted. After that, it will be translated into two other languages (German and French) using another API from IBM ([Translation](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/language-translator)). Then the comment will be saved in a PostgreSQL database and you can view it in `view comments` button. The program is hosted in [Liara platform](https://liara.ir/).
